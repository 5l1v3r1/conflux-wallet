Moreover, FC records every contribution of each member while conducting a wholesome testing on the exsting testnet.\nFor the purpose of acknowledging the contribution from the communtiy, Conflux Foundation committed a 1:1 swap between FC and CFX after the mainnet is launched.

    'FC is primarily designed for recognizing all contributions from the communtiy. Conflux Foundation respects and appraises every legal and positive effort in building the ecosystem, therefore the Foundation strives to be fair and transparent in every pennyworth of FC. All the FC distribution will be announced to the community and open to the public via multiple channles.',

    'The Conflux Foundation issues FC on the promise of prioritizing the FC-CFX swap after the expiration of lock-up periods on Foundationâ€™s ecosystem funds. Both locked and available FC balance are eligible for the mainnet tokenswap. Note that the Foundation reserves the right to investigate and reject a swap request if the FC on the subject is involved in illegal activities or violations of the community code-of-conduct. Details for the exchange process will be released soon.',

    'Community members acquire FC from two sources,\na. incentives from the Conflux Foundation\nb. P2P Transaction within the Conflux Community\nTo motivate members to contribute more and obtain FC via the former, Conflux Foundation makes special adjustment to the liquidity of FC so that FC obtained not directly from the Foundation is subject to a secondary allocation upon transfer; namely, a certain ratio of the transfer amount will be permanently locked for transfer in order to initiate a transfer.',
  contain4:
    'Scenario:\nAssume the current circulation ratio is 100, meaning for every 100 FCs transfer, an addition of 100 FCs will be permanently locked for transfer. Upon completing a Conflux bounty task, Alice receives 10 FCs from Conflux Foundation as our gratitude. Meanwhile, she also receives a transfer from Bob that worth of 10 FCs. At this point, Alice owns a total of 20 FCs, and she would like to transfer some FCs to Denise.',
